4010 Heater Fan with 5015 parts blower fan. Requires different X-carriage included. Should accept LGX lite with mounting plate (untested). Only tested with [Kami extruder](https://github.com/intositeme/kami-mini) using the 'offset-hole' front plate.

Only for Dragon hotend or hotends with similar bolting pattern. 2x Hotend Holder.stl is required, these are just to prevent the hotend from twisting when changing nozzles.

Will loose ~5mm in X/Y travel. Please check this on your printer.

Known Issues, I might/might not fix
- Fan ducts angle is pretty steep and hard to print properly (i just sand it down for cosmetic sake)
- 5015 front inlet cutout might not be centered to the fan, though it is in cad, could be due to GDStime fans being different?
- There might be a small gap in some corners of the print (new to CAD)
